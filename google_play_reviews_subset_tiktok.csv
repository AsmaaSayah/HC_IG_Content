e59cf862-620d-4c91-93e0-5dfeae4499fc,Lynsey,"I don't know how tiktok does it but the algorithm it creates for me specifically is the best thing. Instagram sucks, I stopped using it back in 2020 when I started noticing a bunch of scamy things on there, and facebook also sucks. Both of these apps are very close minded only allowing you to see minimal content and it doesn't connect you to current events. While tiktok on the other hand updates almost immediately with current events all over the world. Such an amazing app.",5,33552,38.2.3,2025-01-16 19:08:38,Thanks for the amazing review!

Tiktok has that. I would be in a much sadder, more lonely place without the friendships, interaction, and sometimes just fun things to learn and watch -without it.",5,25,37.9.3,2025-01-13 19:47:34,,
57cb7735-2a2d-497c-bc65-486b6ae65af1,Ira Zarnofsky (Solari),"I love this app. PLEASE do not let it get banned. (USA) I cannot even believe anyone would try to remove it from a country. (Unless they got something to hide) Tiktok shares lives from around the world, you are able to get coverage much faster such as in times of disaster, making sure everyone is able to have a voice as well as uniting and providing social spaces for everyone around the world. Nothing can replace tiktok in my eyes, the best social app since the end of the original ""myspace"".",5,64,37.9.3,2025-01-03 13:54:06,,
d4ede365-81c1-4cd4-887d-5d91df8fab87,jen soups,"App runs almost flawlessly. I've made many new friends and learned so much on this app. The algorithm is specific and much better than Meta products. I don't know where to go to get the kind of community I've cultivated on tiktok. The app is not without its problems, especially with willy-nilly take downs of posts and replies, but it's heads and shoulders above US-based socials. I'm also disappointed that with the ban, as I'll be losing monetization/TT shop I never had with other apps.",5,40,37.9.3,2025-01-12 03:24:33,,

Most videos never stop loading. And my bars and internet connections are great. Very frustrating.",5,82,38.2.3,2025-01-12 19:09:41,,

6099e5ef-b1b1-4cd0-9cb7-7a42bfc3bcee,Addy May,I love it so much. It really keeps my happiness awake. People shouldn't be saying that it'd bad! Because it isn't. You just need to find the right tiktoks for the right people. Personally I absolutely admire tiktok and it's so useful if your having a bad day. It always cheers you up with the unique as funny as possible tiktoks. People are a laugh on there. And I love it sooooo so so so much. People shouldn't hate it! Because it 'draws to much attention' it really doesn't. It's just a calm web ‚ù§,5,28,37.9.3,2025-01-13 20:44:32,,
e20e8759-2fdd-4401-8482-da003963be93,Tara Bugge,This app is great. The algorithm finds your special interests. I've never had an ad pop up based on something I spoke aloud. There are no pop-up ads. You don't have to wait for ads to finish only to realize that the video wasn't what you were looking for. Regular people have a way to connect with people they never would have met. Non-rich people have an opportunity to supplement their income. TikTok app offers a sense of community where other social media apps are divisive.,5,42,38.2.3,2025-01-14 21:20:24,,
65b78f83-22ca-4164-a602-5f17b737f3d3,Guhan Kantha,Very entertaining app and very secure. I have Galaxy S24 Ultra and it works amazing no lags. Love the layout and Live videos are cool. Very secure especially when signing in it does amazing from preventing unauthorized logins. I really like search results! On Insta if you search something up it comes random things but TikTok it gives you videos that are exactly the topic of the search. Also summarizes other videos and give me summarized info like searching Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 16,5,187,37.9.3,2024-12-30 22:43:21,,

80190caa-6a61-48a4-b32a-5acc629b3f41,Jes Isenberg,"I have learned more on this app than I've ever learned elsewhere. The way in which we are able to easily access information, and communicate with people around the world has been amazing, and in my opinion, crucial. The ease in which we have been able to find communities, and sooth depression? Essential. The comment sections? Hilarious. The entertainment of it all has been the cherry on top of the best and most informative social media platform that has ever existed. Thank you to the creators!",5,27,38.2.3,2025-01-18 06:02:18,Thanks for the great review! We love to hear that!,2025-02-04 23:20:33
7a1386dd-fa11-4877-952a-79e564ac6f72,Justin Ahsaruk,My experience with TikTok has been awesome meeting a ton of people along the way. Including tons of celebrities I thought I would never have a chance to meet and get to know. Plus growing artists and pages. All the special people I have met on this app. Even to be made a moderator cause people harassing so much on persons page. He added me as that and it help me grow . He ask me and I didn't want to decline. It made me search for who I was. (Please don't shut this app down) üôèü•≤ Thank you all!,5,31,37.9.3,2025-01-11 23:38:57,,
